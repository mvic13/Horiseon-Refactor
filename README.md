# Horiseon-Refactor
 ## This is the first refactor I have done. This is also the first assignment of my bootcamp class.
 In this assignment I have taken the time to make the code provided more accesible by adding different elements. I have added semantic elements, added alt attributes for images, and I also added a new title element. 
 While keeping the website page the same as it looked before.
